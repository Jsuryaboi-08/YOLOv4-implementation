# YOLOv4-implementation
This is the just the basic YOLOv4 implementation using the open source Darknet-53 library which is available on github.

First snapshot- importing darknet library and using the darknet53's pretained weights and testing for the proper working and implementation of the logic used to import weights and use them for implemetation of Yolov4 algorithm in pre loaded images and to check the functioning with custom inputs in the form of photos for now.
